# Rasperberry Pi - Real Time Face Recognition
This project is a face recognition system that uses Python and OpenCV to detect and recognise faces in real-time. The system is designed to work on a Raspberry Pi device but can also work on other platforms and is intended for anyone who wants to implement a simple and practical face recognition system for various purposes, such as home security, attendance tracking, or access control.
